By contract they should perform these tasks and scheduled this one on a weekend which should be least impacting to USC.

Per email below, Pinnacle is doing scheduled maintenance on Friday, February 12th from 9:00 pm through 9:00 am Saturday, February 13th,  and Friday, February 19th from 9:00 pm through 9:00 a.m. February 20th, 2021 

We have notified DPS, ITS/Finance, Field Services manager and dispatch supervisor, and Voice Services that are likely to use this system out of hours. 

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Good Afternoon -

As we continually look at processes to minimize inconvenience to you and your teams, Calero-MDSL will be conducting maintenance in January. 
 
Staging instances will be managed as needed after hours on any day, typically between 8 PM and 8 AM ET (GMT-5). 

Your production instance is scheduled for maintenance on Saturday, January 9, 2020.    Maintenance will begin at 12 midnight ET (GMT-5) and go through 12 noon ET (GMT-5). 

During this time, your production instance will not be available for use.

For 2021,  we will be moving to a schedule with two production instance maintenance periods planned.  These will be the 2nd and 3rd Saturdays of each month beginning at 12 AM ET (5 AM GMT) and completing on or before 12 PM ET (5 PM GMT).  While we are keeping the maintenance length the same as 2020, it is expected that each period may not take 12 hours if done more than once in a month.   

During this time, your production instance will not be available for use.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will work to minimize the length of the maintenance window as often as possible.  We will continue to notify you each month of upcoming maintenance two weeks prior to the first maintenance window. 

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns with the 2021 plan. 

Here are the dates (all Saturdays):

After the change, the malicious would be caught (if known) and the email quarantined.
We do receive a few requests a month to investigate email getting quarantined coming inbound or going outbound.  Outbound email often has attached content from malware.  Inbound email usually has a malicious link included in the email.

These changes to policy may be an issue for phishing email being reported to the Security Team.  We may need to create new policies explicitly for security@usc.edu and phishing@usc.edu to not block email for being malicious as that information is required for investigating a case.

By contract they should perform these tasks and scheduled this one on a weekend which should be least impacting to USC.

We have notified DPS, ITS/Finance, Field Services manager and dispatch supervisor, and Voice Services that are likely to use this system out of hours. 

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________

Good Afternoon -

As we continually look at processes to minimize inconvenience to you and your teams, Calero-MDSL will be conducting maintenance in January. 
 
Staging instances will be managed as needed after hours on any day, typically between 8 PM and 8 AM ET (GMT-5). 

Your production instance is scheduled for maintenance on Saturday, January 9, 2020.    Maintenance will begin at 12 midnight ET (GMT-5) and go through 12 noon ET (GMT-5). 

During this time, your production instance will not be available for use.

For 2021,  we will be moving to a schedule with two production instance maintenance periods planned.  These will be the 2nd and 3rd Saturdays of each month beginning at 12 AM ET (5 AM GMT) and completing on or before 12 PM ET (5 PM GMT).  While we are keeping the maintenance length the same as 2020, it is expected that each period may not take 12 hours if done more than once in a month.   

During this time, your production instance will not be available for use.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will work to minimize the length of the maintenance window as often as possible.  We will continue to notify you each month of upcoming maintenance two weeks prior to the first maintenance window. 

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns with the 2021 plan. 

Here are the dates (all Saturdays):

 Attached are the updated panel schedules in Excel and PDF formats for rooms 407, 409, 417, 417C and 450. Also attached the last assessment report that was done back in 2017, which is for sure is outdated. Change date modified from November to December 19th with an ending date of January 18, 2021. 
 
FMS scheduled CAL Power Shutdown and Transfer for the  new Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to transfer the Power Distribution  24 UNITS (PDUs) to the new Switch boards (SWBD) in CAL 460 main power room  and CAL 430 Power room II. 

* Aman and the DC Analyst have requested temporary power to help reduce the loss of power during of the power transfers. This power will be allocated for select PDUs.
* Dates were reviewed and scheduled around the academic calendar, end of semester, registration dates and start of semester. We also reviewed end of year and monthly financial dates.

Scheduled PDU rooms, See attached Schedule
- CAL 404 (PDU 23) 
- CAL 324 ( PDU 31)
- CAL 407 - EMPOE ( PDU 15) 
- CAL 409 - Colocation I (PDU, 13, 20,24) 
- CAL 417  Enterprise Data (PDU 4,21, 5,7)
- CAL 417c CARC- Formerly HPC (8,10, 9,11,18,19,22)
- CAL 450  Colocation II (PDU 1,2,16)
- CAL 430 New Power Room II

Power shutdown dates have changed, see the attached Copy of the schedule. Only one PDU will be down at a time.

FMS provided information from the Power Survey provided by the vendor.
IMPORTANT: This survey took place on Friday, 8/21/20. Any circuiting changes after that date won't be reflected on these schedules. This is valuable and I would highly suggest if you plan on having work done for any circuit modifications, someone needs to be the gate keeper for these schedules and make sure they are updated electronically and in the field so that you maintain an accurate record keeping. If ITS is short on manpower, I would suggest re-instating the engineers contract for the bi-annual or quarterly survey. The only changes to apply to these schedules is the power source change to each PDU after the completion of the UPS upgrade project. So once the UPS project is complete, I will update these schedules to reflect the new information so that you have the latest and greatest.
 
The engineer is still working on updated rack layout updates and should send within couple of days. However, the updated schedules should get us going for the UPS upgrade purposes.

 We are looking to start PDU shutdowns on Monday 9/28, starting with PDU 4. Then we will try to schedule 2 PDU shutdowns per day thereafter. The 2 PDUs would be in different rooms to minimize shutdowns to customers or need for temp power. The anticipated shutdown duration is 8-9 hours for every 2 PDUs. I need input from the ITS team this week in order to start submitting formal shutdown requests and get them on the calendar. Let me know if we need to have a quick follow up zoom call.

 Thanks,

Michael

FMS scheduled CAL Power Shutdown and Transfer for the  new Uninterruptible Power Supply (UPS) to transfer the Power Distribution  24 UNITS (PDUs) to the new Switch boards (SWBD) in CAL 460 main power room  and CAL 430 Power room II. 

* Aman and the DC Analyst have requested temporary power to help reduce the loss of power during of the power transfers. This power will be allocated for select PDUs.
* Dates were reviewed and scheduled around the academic calendar, end of semester, registration dates and start of semester. We also reviewed end of year and monthly financial dates.

Power shutdown dates have changed, see the attached Copy of the schedule. Only one PDU will be down at a time.

FMS provided information from the Power Survey provided by the vendor.
IMPORTANT: This survey took place on Friday, 8/21/20. Any circuiting changes after that date won't be reflected on these schedules. This is valuable and I would highly suggest if you plan on having work done for any circuit modifications, someone needs to be the gate keeper for these schedules and make sure they are updated electronically and in the field so that you maintain an accurate record keeping. If ITS is short on manpower, I would suggest re-instating the engineers contract for the bi-annual or quarterly survey. The only changes to apply to these schedules is the power source change to each PDU after the completion of the UPS upgrade project. So once the UPS project is complete, I will update these schedules to reflect the new information so that you have the latest and greatest.
 
The engineer is still working on updated rack layout updates and should send within couple of days. However, the updated schedules should get us going for the UPS upgrade purposes.

 We are looking to start PDU shutdowns on Monday 9/28, starting with PDU 4. Then we will try to schedule 2 PDU shutdowns per day thereafter. The 2 PDUs would be in different rooms to minimize shutdowns to customers or need for temp power. The anticipated shutdown duration is 8-9 hours for every 2 PDUs. I need input from the ITS team this week in order to start submitting formal shutdown requests and get them on the calendar. Let me know if we need to have a quick follow up zoom call.

The rest of the services will undergo an outage while the Load Balancer  GSLB configuration is updated and we work with Senior Engineers at Citrix TAC on troubleshooting. Once complete, we will ask ITS teams on the bridge to test connectivity to all apps residing on MSB-LB3/4 and the firewall team will verify that the GSLB configurations are back in place by running a 'dig' command to ensure that the Authoritative record is correct for each service. 

We are anticipating this change to take anywhere from 90 minutes to 2.5 hours.

We have notified DPS, ITS/Finance, Field Services manager and dispatch supervisor, and Voice Services that are likely to use this system out of hours. 

We would like to add this as an Emergency change.
___________________________________________________________________________________________

Good Afternoon -

As we continually look at processes to minimize inconvenience to you and your teams, Calero-MDSL will be conducting maintenance in December. 
 
Staging instances will be managed as needed after hours on any day, typically between 8 PM and 8 AM ET (GMT-5). 

Your production instance is scheduled for maintenance on Saturday, December 12, 2020.    Maintenance will begin at 12 midnight ET (GMT-5) and go through 12 noon ET (GMT-5). 

During this time, your production instance will not be available for use.

For 2021,  we will be moving to a schedule with two production instance maintenance periods planned.  These will be the 2nd and 3rd Saturdays of each month beginning at 12 AM ET (5 AM GMT) and completing on or before 12 PM ET (5 PM GMT).  While we are keeping the maintenance length the same as 2020, it is expected that each period may not take 12 hours if done more than once in a month.   

During this time, your production instance will not be available for use.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will work to minimize the length of the maintenance window as often as possible.  We will continue to notify you each month of upcoming maintenance two weeks prior to the first maintenance window. 

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns with the 2021 plan. 

Here are the dates (all Saturdays):

By contract they should perform these tasks and scheduled this one on a weekend which should be least impacting to USC.

___________________________________________________________________________________________

Good Afternoon -

As we continually look at processes to minimize inconvenience to you and your teams, Calero-MDSL will be conducting maintenance in December. 
 
Staging instances will be managed as needed after hours on any day, typically between 8 PM and 8 AM ET (GMT-5). 

Your production instance is scheduled for maintenance on Saturday, December 12, 2020.    Maintenance will begin at 12 midnight ET (GMT-5) and go through 12 noon ET (GMT-5). 

During this time, your production instance will not be available for use.

For 2021,  we will be moving to a schedule with two production instance maintenance periods planned.  These will be the 2nd and 3rd Saturdays of each month beginning at 12 AM ET (5 AM GMT) and completing on or before 12 PM ET (5 PM GMT).  While we are keeping the maintenance length the same as 2020, it is expected that each period may not take 12 hours if done more than once in a month.   

During this time, your production instance will not be available for use.  We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause and will work to minimize the length of the maintenance window as often as possible.  We will continue to notify you each month of upcoming maintenance two weeks prior to the first maintenance window. 

Please let me know if you have questions or concerns with the 2021 plan. 

Here are the dates (all Saturdays):

photography.usc.edu is an alias for www.spitfirephoto.com.
www.spitfirephoto.com has address 52.217.36.155

The prior administrators haven't had access to the host for years.
Ads are being hosted on the site below the photography.usc.edu link.

Example: http://photography.usc.edu/7lil/23-mrs-carmella-morar/

Removal of the alias in DNS will remove the connection to USC.

Trying to contact the current owner of www.spitfirephoto.com have met with no replies, but the top level photography.usc.edu webpage was changed to an Under Construction page instead of pointing back to pressroom.usc.edu.

Under Construction
Our website is currently undergoing scheduled maintenance.
We should be back shortly. Thank you for your patience.

This has changed again, and now points back to https://www.usc.edu at the top level, but the ad links still work.

When this happens, we see Microsoft's IP address, rather than the client.  This causes gaps in security alerting for multiple accounts used from the same IP.  It also makes locked account troubleshooting difficult because if somemone leaves an old password configured in their IMAP client, we cannot trace this to an IP address to help them identify where the problem is coming from.

Microsoft records the IP address of the connecting user in an HTTP header that they send during authentication.  This change is to log that header on a successful authentication response, and in an invalid password response.

The current version is 2.0 and the latest version is 4.0 ( We are way behind the version).  This may have security implications that need to be addressed.  We want to enable the auto-restart of the service, and the upgrade overrides this setting, so it must be done after the upgrade.  So we want to schedule the upgrade and the service restarter together.

Failure of restarting duo auth services is stopping from CyberVault user's from logging into CyberVault to fetch/use their privileged accounts. We have performed the upgrade on stage successfully and monitored for issue accordingly.

Note : The auth proxy services are load balanced and with us doing this as a rolling upgrade, this should not affect users.  The load balancer should direct traffic to the currently functioning server at all times.  Still, there is a small chance that mechanism won't work and there might be disturbance on access CyberVault during the change window. Existing CyberVault sessions will be unaffected.

The second ASA needs switchports enabled to commence the testing. We want to use the ASA devices to test the implementation of ASA VPN Load balancing (cluster technology). By using the test devices, we minimize any risk of an outage while fine-tuning the needed configuration. 

Firewall Services attempted DNS load balancing for VPN access in March but this did not provide us with the results that we wanted, so now we are going to try using Cisco supported Load Balancing (SAML may be a concern to make this work) with the goal to increase the availability of ASA licenses for a potential increase in the number of students/faculty/staff utilizing VPN when classes start.

This second device needs to connect to the fabric at CAL, we are requesting to enable two ports on CAL-3810-AG1 and possibly one more port in CAL 417 to configure the test environment. The ports will only be used for the purpose of testing load balancing the ASAs. If this plan does not work we will have the parameters in place to test  Citrix Load Balancing hosted by the Netscalers. 

Configuration will include bringing up the port and all necessary tagging or edits needed to establish the testing environment. We will be careful not to disrupt the production networks with this change.

A script has been developed to delete the student data using a list provided by the Student system.  If a record has student and non student (employee or guest) data, the script will intelligently remove the student  data keeping the other data in place.  It will take over 100 hours to delete all the data of the 3 million plus student records.  The plan is to run blocks of deletes (250K records per block) on off peak hour to minimize the impact to the database.  If the impact to the PR database is minimal, then the script may be run more often.
The initial runs will be of small block sizes to better evaluate the potential impact to the Production Oracle database.  This run will be 250K records.

    Added lsavage to IAM
    
    Linda was previously being subtly pulled from NIS.  This creates
    an account for her in the always-local model that Sravya and Ajay
    have.
    
    I also fixed the duplication in the always-local model where
    those two were in an if and an else.  I just moved them below.
    
    This is needed because IAM machines can no longer see Linda's NIS
    account.
    
    Tested on pr-dev3.

These student records are still in the PR database and it is a liability to keep these records in PR database.
A script has been developed to delete the student data using a list provided by the Student system.  If a record has student and non student (employee or guest) data, the script will intelligently remove the student  data keeping the other data in place.  It will take over 100 hours to delete all the data of the 3 million plus student records.  The plan is to run blocks of deletes (250K records per block) on off peak hour to minimize the impact to the database.  If the impact to the PR database is minimal, then the script may be run more often.
The initial runs will be of small block sizes to better evaluate the potential impact to the Production Oracle database.  This run will be 250K records.

This is done to protect servers from invalid X-Forwarded-For headers set maliciously by clients, but we do need the information sometimes.  Particularly, this is the reason we had to cancel CHG0043932, where we hoped to collect client IPs from Microsoft on IMAP/SMTP.  This change is to configure the load balancers to rename the X-Forwarded-For header to X-Forwarded-EXT, rather than a random string.

It is a global change that will affect up to 150 websites.  The implementation should not require a downtime or disrupt any traffic.

In anticipation of bringing these devices online we are running a stress test at THH with 66 Crestron Encoders/Decoders for USC ITS Network. ITS Network Team has to remove the multicast rate on the ports where the Crestron Encoders are connected to begin the test.

I have attached a list of devices which are connected to the first floor closet in THH for testing of Crestron Multicast devices. Picture of the closet with the devices connected to the Network Switch is also attached to the case.

The CAT cables which are Blue and Black are the ones that the Crestron Encoders/Decoders are connected to the Network Switch with.

    AccountMapper
    
    This implements an adapter for AccountMapper, which calculates NameIDs.
    The feature for this release is allowing a NameID format configured
    with a separator (@), to send the left side of the @ to the SP, while
    looking up the whole NameID format with the @ sign in the IdP formats
    list.
    
    So you can configure in the IdP
    formats:
    urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified@uscUSCID
    values:
    urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified@uscUSCID=uscUSCID
    and in the SP:
    NameID Formats:
    urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified@uscUSCID
    and what will really get sent to the SP is format
    urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:1.1:nameid-format:unspecified
    with a value of the uscUSCID.

Date:   Wed Jun 10 19:06:30 2020 -0700

    Implements the preSignResponse side of AM-169
    
    This implements a preSignResponse class that checks for the uscUnauthorized
    flag and sends a Requester/RequestDenied response to the SP if the flag
    is set.
    
    Also, renamed USCAttributeMapper directory to USCAdapters to include the
    increased scope of the package.

    Implements the AttributeMapper side of AM-169
    
    This sets a new session variable for the user in their cookie
    to say whether or not they are authorized for an application.
    
    This will later be picked up by the preSignResponse handler, which
    will make send an error message to the SP.

We will first audit DMARC to see what email is coming in based on several scenarios.
In the near future we will start to add DMARC records to subdomains to only approve email from those subdomains through USC or validated third party senders.
This should eliminate a large portion of currently forged emails from being received.

The preliminary work has been completed.
Policy routes and quarantines were created.

All that's left to do is to:
Enable the MyDomains_From and  DMARC_Safe policies
and turn on the DMARC module and disable processing for DMARC_Safe (domains).

After implementation we will monitor the quarantines to make sure they don't get too large and scale back retention if necessary.


06/15/2020 4pm update:

After speaking with Ian Buchanan from Proofpoint, we'll make these audit quarantines retain email for 1 day instead of 2 weeks to start:

    DMARC_rorecordfailspf, DMARC_quarantine, DMARC_reject and DMARC_mydomains_none.

As  no email should hit the mydomains_from policy rule norecordfailspf, that rule is removed as well as the DMARC_mydomains_rorecordfailspf, quarantine.

Because of how the network for the load balancers is situated, the load balancers record the TCP/IP IP address of the client that connects directly to them and stores it in the X-Forwarded-For header, replacing whatever was in there.  The Shibboleth servers then see the X-Forwarded-For header set by the load balancer, but the source IP of the load balancer.  Because we can't trust a client not to fake an X-Forwarded-For header, we throw away the original header.

This change is to have the load balancer set a new header called X-Forwarded-USC instead, and leave the original X-Forwarded-For header intact.  This requires downstream changes to those systems who receive these headers.  It will allow us to record the IMAP and SMTP client IP addresses in our logs, which is an important security mechanism that may help us block abuse of our systems on the Microsoft end.

These student records are still in the PR database and it is a liability to keep these records in PR database.
A script has been developed to delete the student data using a list provided by the Student system.  If a record has student and non student (employee or guest) data, the script will intelligently remove the student  data keeping the other data in place.  It will take over 100 hours to delete all the data of the 3 million plus student records.  The plan is to run blocks of deletes (250K records per block) on off peak hour to minimize the impact to the database.  If the impact to the PR database is minimal, then the script may be run more often.
The initial runs will be of small block sizes to better evaluate the potential impact to the Production Oracle database.  This run will be 90K records.

If a record has student and non student (employee or guest) data, the script will intelligently remove the student  data keeping the other data in place.  It will take over 100 hours to delete all the data of the 3 million plus student records.  The plan is to run blocks of deletes (250K records per block) on off peak hour to minimize the impact to the database.

The initial runs will be of small block sizes to better evaluate the potential impact to the Production Oracle database.  This run will be 40K records.

Subject: RE: PHE 1st Floor IT Room


Good morning, Nancy and Aman-

Our CPS shop did a survey of electrical outlets under raised floor for ITS telecom room and made sure everything was traced and labeled. They also labeled floor tiles to make it easier to locate where things are, as well as label UPS cords for ease of identification.

Based on survey we found the following circuits being used. We couldn't verify outlets types because we didn't want to unplug anything, so I'll need ITS group to confirm outlet/plug types. I can make an educated guess on what they are, but I still need your confirmation. You will need to unplug the UPSs to verify.

- PNL EMERG, Circuits 19,21, 30A-2 Pole. This is probably L6-30R.
- PNL EMERG, Circuits 23,25, 30A-2 Pole. This is probably L6-30R.
- PNL EMERG, Circuit 14, 30A-1 Pole. This is probably L5-30R.
- PNL T (Normal Power), Circuit 38, 30A-1 Pole. This is probably L5-30R.

Also, Nancy did mention that you are planning to replace exiting raised floor to meet current seismic requirements. If I may suggest, that would be the perfect time to go through a major underfloor cleanup. Given the critical nature of that corner, there is so much accumulation of wires and flex conduits all over the place that seem no longer in service. The underfloor space is shallow and with all the abandoned stuff, air circulation is definitely being affected.

Thanks,

Michael

Subject: PHE 1st Floor IT Room

Hi, Aman-

Hope all is well. I'm working on a project at PHE, part of which is to bring additional emergency power to 1st floor to support ITS space cooling and future needs. As a result we are doing modifications to both normal and emergency systems wiring, which essentially will require a building shutdown.

This will affect ITS corner at PHE. I'm working with the contractor to develop MOP for shutdown and I'll need to insert details on how to support ITS corner during the shutdown period. I have access to room 108; however, I'll need access to 108D to complete my survey. I believe the area is served by a dedicated emergency panel; however, I would like to confirm all circuits serving the space. I don't recall if the room has a central or rack UPSs. Either way I'll need clarification from ITS on how long the UPS(s) can support the corner while we make/break temp connections.

All equipment have already been installed and we're only waiting for the cutover to complete the installation. I will be on site tomorrow if there is an opportunity for anyone to get me in the rooms. If tomorrow doesn't work, we can arrange for another day.

Once I have a detailed plan, I'll share with you and ITS team for discussion.

As discussed, the issue that you are facing for High Tx utilization on unintended ports has already reported as a Crash in an older version of the Switch CR134910. Hence, I would request you to please go ahead and reboot the Switches using boot system command to reboot the entire Chassis.

The Configuration is all okay, no further changes required in that.

After discussions with students, faculty leaders, and deans, we are modifying our policy on undergraduate pass/no pass grades for this semester to give students the flexibility to decide what is best for them given the varying environments and individual challenges each student is facing. We know this has been an area of great concern.

Under the new terms, undergraduate students will have the freedom to opt for a letter grade, a Pass or a No Record up to a week after official class grades are posted. The deadline is May 27 to select these options. All other communicated dates no longer apply. The No Record option will work like a withdrawal except that there will be no transcript notation that the student took the course. Every student's transcript will note that the semester was disrupted due to COVID-19.

We also know there are a lot of concerns and questions remaining about grading options at the graduate level. The provost is working with the deans on this, and we will issue FAQs in the coming days.

We are changing the logic to allow the user to change their password when the user successfully authenticates against Kerberos and their  'AccountClaimStatus' is not set in MyAccess.  It will automatically set the AccountClaimStatus to 'true' at that point.  This is an important change, because it prevents generic errors that will confuse many people while trying to change their password, and we are running a campaign to expire many such people's passwords so they will need to change their password.

1.	Create an account on Zoom with Production API Access on Master Account for downloading of Users and Meetings. 

Testing Plan:
Follow the steps below on creating the app credentials.
Run program to download data.
Query database to see if data was downloaded.

Created app on test zoom:

Created program to download all users, and meetings to PE database.
Users:

We will need to make one small change to our code to store the account that each user,meeting is in for the users and meetings that aren't on the enterprise account.

Back out plan:
Delete App on the Zoom App Marketplace
Use manual download of users and meetings

Risks:
Very low since we are downloading data on users and meetings.
API Rate limits on Zoom itself will prevent overloading on the system.
2.	Create Tracking Field on Zoom for Blackboard Zoom LTI to populate when professors create meetings via the Zoom LTI on Blackboard.

Back out Plan:
Delete tracking field
Delete the configuration of tracking field on Zoom LTI
Delete the configuration of the parameter on Blackboard 

Testing Plan:
Follow the steps as were done in DEV, and create meeting on production blackboard on our test class, to see if it is working properly.

Configured the zoom and added the blackboard_course_batch_uid tracking field

Configured LTI to populate the field.

Configured LTI to populate the field.

Blackboard team also needs to configure their piece as well.

Risks:
Low since the tracking field is an optional field and can be deleted from the configurations easily if it is causing issues.

    New ELK CA
    
    I was using the puppet CA infrastructure to authenticate ELK clients
    (they're also authenticated by iptables).  But that got too tricky
    with multiple puppet masters.
    
    So this pushes a cert and a key to the ELK clients to use to log
    into filebeat with.
    
    It's the same cert and key for every host, and the key is in this code
    repo.  But this is all I can come up with at the moment.

An updated architecture is needed that enforces stateful firewall inspection for public-facing applications and provides high-availability by eliminating the single-point-of-failure edge firewall.

    Removed the lines about disabling tomcat8 repo
    
    There was some transitional code in here to disable the tomcat8
    repository.  Now that has succeeded, we don't need that anymore.
    
    The tomcat8 repo code doesn't work on puppet4.  I'll try to fix that

The Department of Education (ED) on Thursday released an updated final version of the 2020-21 College Financing Plan, along with HTML specifications and a Frequently Asked Questions document. As noted in the IFAP announcement, in order to make improvements to last year's Responsive Preview and finalize a single template for 2020-2021, ED reviewed NASFAA's No Clear Winner: Consumer Testing of Financial Aid Award Letters report and worked with NASFAA to collect input from financial aid administrators, students, parents, and other stakeholders. Institutions that have agreed to comply with the Principles of Excellence (POE) in Executive Order 13607 (EO 13607) and other participating institutions will use the College Financing Plan in place of ED's Shopping Sheet. The FAQ states that software providers are confident that participating institutions will be able to implement the College Financing Plan during the 2020-2021 award year. Keep an eye on Today's News for a forthcoming article detailing the changes.

    Add ca_psmp and ca_recon to maintenance users

    The new service account ca_psmp, and ca_recon should be
    allowed to login interactively to the server.  ca_recon needs

    Integrated changes for ca_psmp

    This enables the ca_psmp user from localusers and access
    for the psmp servers.  This moves to the tmpl version of the

    I also removed Yanni, who doesn't work for us anymore.

    Unless we maintain this line with every personel change or build a spaceship,
    this is the best I can come up with for now on how to manage access to these
    servers.

    That is, everyone logs in via ca_logon, unless they don't have that account.

    sshd_config for IAM ETL

    We wanted to allow ssh keys for ETL service accounts.  But since they're
    in FACL directories, sshd is confused and thinks the users have insecure
    permissions.  It reads 700+iamadmin as 770.  So this sshd_config
    is copied from the ssh module, but turns StrictModes=no to get around
    that issue.

    There's a new direction with ivip to run on a RHEL supported
    tomcat, which is version 7, and a RHEL supported java, which is
    openjdk-11.  So here's a new class called ivip_2019, because
    there's an old ivip, a new one, an abandoned one, and some other ones,
    so 2019 made sense.  It's the same as classic, but uses different versions
    of openjdk and tomcat.

    PS1: took out all the stuff about cal-katello being down.  I had
    some sketchiness in there because yum commands were taking 3 minutes
    each and this had to run lots of yum commands to transition an old server

    Shibboleth Apache Migration

    The shib_idp::with_apache class is a new class very similar to init.pp.

    It adds apache as a proxy to Shibboleth in order to facilitate the use of
    the Shibboleth SP.  The SP is used to redirect traffic to ForgeRock on
    login.usc.edu for password authentication.

    The class installs Shibboleth SP, apache, and turns off the jetty iptables
    proxy that redirected port 443 to 7443.  Now apache proxies the traffic.

    This is done as a new submodule to allow for individual server migration.

Dear Tom,

I hope this email finds you well.

My advisor recently purchased some limited-seat floating licenses for the use of Xilinx SDSoC and SDAccel software tools in our group. It seems like I need to generate the corresponding .lic file and install it on a server (as the licenses are floating), and then check out the licenses from that server. 

As we are currently checking out our Xilinx licenses from this address/server: 1713@lic-xilinx.usc.edu, should I generate the corresponding .lic file for this server? If yes, from the Xilinx website it seems like I should have the Hostname and Host ID of the server? could you please give me that information so I can send you the corresponding .lic file and then you can install it there?

Furthermore, is there a way that the people of our group are given priority for the use of these licenses (as these licenses are limited seated)? By the way, we have a server in our group as well, so maybe installing the .lic on that server could be the solution. But I don't know how to install the corresponding .lic file on our server.

Best,
Amirhossein.


Thank you Amirhossein,

I will just have to let Dr. Puvvada know that I am making a change as he as asked to be notified whenever I make a change that will affect the software used in his classes. This way he can notify his students of the change as well, I think in case that it causes an unplanned outage.

I have added Dr. Puvvada to this email thread.

If there is no objection I can add the new license lines and restart the Xilinx license server tomorrow evening.

Best,

Tom

In June 2019, the UTC End of Year Report recommended that ITS explore Zoom as a USC-approved, multi-tenant campus-wide collaboration service. 

In response to this recommendation ITS is launching the USC Zoom video and audio conferencing service for all students, faculty and staff on January 21, 2020. USC Zoom accounts are essentially Zoom Pro accounts that are available at no cost to members of the USC community.

 Zoom materially contributes to a digital campus.  Zoom integrates with Blackboard, USC's Learning Management System,� provides students seamless access to a capable and intuitive conferencing solution that enables connectivity to produce required work, leveraging connectivity to and collaboration with other students and the university.?

This is a Service Transition / service extension announcement of Zoom Software as a Service (SaaS) capability for all  students, faculty and staff of the enterprise license.  This is the official launch.  Zoom is currently used by 21 USC schools and departments under separate license agreements that will be migrated to the enterprise license.  

Release Strategy?
Phase I:    January 21, 2020:   Release Single Use Licenses to Students, Faculty? and Staff
Phase II:   March - June:           Zoom Integrated with Blackboard (Learning Environments)?
Phase III:� May -  August:          Activate Zoom Rooms in Shared Classrooms (aligned with A/V equipment upgrades)?

We are temporarily converting cal-its-esxi-01 into a migration machine to move workloads to our HCI environment.
